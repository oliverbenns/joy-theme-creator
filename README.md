# Joy Theme Creator

_Note: currently a work in progress - some things may not be finished or working as expected._

This project exposes the theming options available in [Joy UI](https://mui.com/joy-ui/getting-started/overview) by providing color palette and typography controls.

It also provides the ability for you to copy the theme configuration object directly into your own Joy UI project's source code after tinkering with these controls.

## Quick Start

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

- `npm start` to start the app in development mode.
- `npm run build` to build the app ready for production.
